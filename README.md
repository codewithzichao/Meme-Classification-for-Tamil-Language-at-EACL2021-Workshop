```

## Installation
Use the following command so that you can install all of required packages:
```shell
sh install_cli.sh
```

## Preprocessing
The first step is to preprocess the data. Just use the following command:
```shell
python3 -u preprocessing.py
```

## Training
The second step is to train our model. Use the following command:
```shell
nohup sh run.sh > run_log.log 2>&1 &
```

## Inference
The final step is inference after training. Use the following command:
```shell
nohup python3 -u inference.py > inference.log 2>&1 &
```
Congralutions! You have got the final results!ðŸ¤©
